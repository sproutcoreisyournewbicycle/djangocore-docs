<p>If you think working <em>with</em> Django is fun, wait until you start working <em>on</em> it.
We&#8217;re passionate about helping Django users make the jump to contributing members
of the community, so there are many ways you can help Django&#8217;s development:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Blog about Django.  We syndicate all the Django blogs we know about on
the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangoproject.com/community/">community page</a>; contact <a class="reference external" href="mailto:jacob&#37;&#52;&#48;jacobian&#46;org">jacob<span>&#64;</span>jacobian<span>&#46;</span>org</a> if you&#8217;ve got a blog
you&#8217;d like to see on that page.</li>
<li>Report bugs and request features in our <a class="reference external" href="http://code.djangoproject.com/newticket">ticket tracker</a>.  Please read
<a class="reference internal" href="#id1">Reporting bugs</a>, below, for the details on how we like our bug reports
served up.</li>
<li>Submit patches for new and/or fixed behavior.  Please read <a class="reference internal" href="#submitting-patches">Submitting
patches</a>, below, for details on how to submit a patch.</li>
<li>Join the <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers">django-developers</a> mailing list and share your ideas for how
to improve Django.  We&#8217;re always open to suggestions, although we&#8217;re
likely to be skeptical of large-scale suggestions without some code to
back it up.</li>
<li>Triage patches that have been submitted by other users. Please read
<a class="reference internal" href="#ticket-triage">Ticket triage</a> below, for details on the triage process.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s all you need to know if you&#8217;d like to join the Django development
community. The rest of this document describes the details of how our community
works and how it handles bugs, mailing lists, and all the other minutiae of
Django development.</p>
<div class="section" id="s-reporting-bugs">
<span id="s-id1"></span><span id="reporting-bugs"></span><span id="id1"></span><h2>Reporting bugs<a class="headerlink" href="#reporting-bugs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Well-written bug reports are <em>incredibly</em> helpful. However, there&#8217;s a certain
amount of overhead involved in working with any bug tracking system, so your
help in keeping our ticket tracker as useful as possible is appreciated.  In
particular:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Do</strong> read the <a class="reference external" href="../faq/index.html#faq-index"><em>FAQ</em></a> to see if your issue might be a well-known question.</li>
<li><strong>Do</strong> <a class="reference external" href="http://code.djangoproject.com/search">search the tracker</a> to see if your issue has already been filed.</li>
<li><strong>Do</strong> ask on <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-users">django-users</a> <em>first</em> if you&#8217;re not sure if what you&#8217;re
seeing is a bug.</li>
<li><strong>Do</strong> write complete, reproducible, specific bug reports. Include as
much information as you possibly can, complete with code snippets, test
cases, etc. This means including a clear, concise description of the
problem, and a clear set of instructions for replicating the problem.
A minimal example that illustrates the bug in a nice small test case
is the best possible bug report.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t</strong> use the ticket system to ask support questions.  Use the
<a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-users">django-users</a> list, or the <a class="reference external" href="irc://irc.freenode.net/django">#django</a> IRC channel for that.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t</strong> use the ticket system to make large-scale feature requests.
We like to discuss any big changes to Django&#8217;s core on the <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers">django-developers</a>
list before actually working on them.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t</strong> reopen issues that have been marked &#8220;wontfix&#8221;. This mark means
that the decision has been made that we can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t fix this particular
issue.  If you&#8217;re not sure why, please ask on <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers">django-developers</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t</strong> use the ticket tracker for lengthy discussions, because they&#8217;re
likely to get lost. If a particular ticket is controversial, please move
discussion to <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers">django-developers</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t</strong> post to django-developers just to announce that you have filed
a bug report. All the tickets are mailed to another list
(<a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-updates">django-updates</a>), which is tracked by developers and triagers, so we
see them as they are filed.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="s-reporting-security-issues">
<span id="s-id2"></span><span id="reporting-security-issues"></span><span id="id2"></span><h2>Reporting security issues<a class="headerlink" href="#reporting-security-issues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Report security issues to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:security&#37;&#52;&#48;djangoproject&#46;com">security<span>&#64;</span>djangoproject<span>&#46;</span>com</a>. This is a private list
only open to long-time, highly trusted Django developers, and its archives are
not publicly readable.</p>
<p>In the event of a confirmed vulnerability in Django itself, we will take the
following actions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Acknowledge to the reporter that we&#8217;ve received the report and that a fix
is forthcoming. We&#8217;ll give a rough timeline and ask the reporter to keep
the issue confidential until we announce it.</li>
<li>Halt all other development as long as is needed to develop a fix, including
patches against the current and two previous releases.</li>
<li>Determine a go-public date for announcing the vulnerability and the fix.
To try to mitigate a possible &#8220;arms race&#8221; between those applying the patch
and those trying to exploit the hole, we will not announce security
problems immediately.</li>
<li>Pre-notify everyone we know to be running the affected version(s) of
Django. We will send these notifications through private e-mail which will
include documentation of the vulnerability, links to the relevant patch(es),
and a request to keep the vulnerability confidential until the official
go-public date.</li>
<li>Publicly announce the vulnerability and the fix on the pre-determined
go-public date. This will probably mean a new release of Django, but
in some cases it may simply be patches against current releases.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="s-submitting-patches">
<span id="submitting-patches"></span><h2>Submitting patches<a class="headerlink" href="#submitting-patches" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We&#8217;re always grateful for patches to Django&#8217;s code. Indeed, bug reports with
associated patches will get fixed <em>far</em> more quickly than those without patches.</p>
<div class="section" id="s-claiming-tickets">
<span id="claiming-tickets"></span><h3>&#8220;Claiming&#8221; tickets<a class="headerlink" href="#claiming-tickets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In an open-source project with hundreds of contributors around the world, it&#8217;s
important to manage communication efficiently so that work doesn&#8217;t get
duplicated and contributors can be as effective as possible. Hence, our policy
is for contributors to &#8220;claim&#8221; tickets in order to let other developers know
that a particular bug or feature is being worked on.</p>
<p>If you have identified a contribution you want to make and you&#8217;re capable of
fixing it (as measured by your coding ability, knowledge of Django internals
and time availability), claim it by following these steps:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangoproject.com/accounts/register/">Create an account</a> to use in our ticket system.</li>
<li>If a ticket for this issue doesn&#8217;t exist yet, create one in our
<a class="reference external" href="http://code.djangoproject.com/newticket">ticket tracker</a>.</li>
<li>If a ticket for this issue already exists, make sure nobody else has
claimed it. To do this, look at the &#8220;Assigned to&#8221; section of the ticket.
If it&#8217;s assigned to &#8220;nobody,&#8221; then it&#8217;s available to be claimed.
Otherwise, somebody else is working on this ticket, and you either find
another bug/feature to work on, or contact the developer working on the
ticket to offer your help.</li>
<li>Log into your account, if you haven&#8217;t already, by clicking &#8220;Login&#8221; in the
upper right of the ticket page.</li>
<li>Claim the ticket by clicking the radio button next to &#8220;Accept ticket&#8221;
near the bottom of the page, then clicking &#8220;Submit changes.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="s-ticket-claimers-responsibility">
<span id="ticket-claimers-responsibility"></span><h4>Ticket claimers&#8217; responsibility<a class="headerlink" href="#ticket-claimers-responsibility" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve claimed a ticket, you have a responsibility to work on that ticket
in a reasonably timely fashion. If you don&#8217;t have time to work on it, either
unclaim it or don&#8217;t claim it in the first place!</p>
<p>Ticket triagers go through the list of claimed tickets from time to
time, checking whether any progress has been made. If there&#8217;s no sign of
progress on a particular claimed ticket for a week or two, a triager may ask
you to relinquish the ticket claim so that it&#8217;s no longer monopolized and
somebody else can claim it.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve claimed a ticket and it&#8217;s taking a long time (days or weeks) to code,
keep everybody updated by posting comments on the ticket. If you don&#8217;t provide
regular updates, and you don&#8217;t respond to a request for a progress report,
your claim on the ticket may be revoked. As always, more communication is
better than less communication!</p>

<span id="which-tickets-should-be-claimed"></span><h4>Which tickets should be claimed?<a class="headerlink" href="#which-tickets-should-be-claimed" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Of course, going through the steps of claiming tickets is overkill in some
cases. In the case of small changes, such as typos in the documentation or
small bugs that will only take a few minutes to fix, you don&#8217;t need to jump
through the hoops of claiming tickets. Just submit your patch and be done with
it.</p>

An exception is for code changes that are described more clearly in plain

read patches when the only difference in code is that it&#8217;s indented.</p>
<p>Patches in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">diff</span></tt> format are also acceptable.</p>

been discussed on <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers">django-developers</a>. If you&#8217;re not sure whether your patch

</div>
<div class="section" id="s-ticket-triage">
<span id="ticket-triage"></span><h2>Ticket triage<a class="headerlink" href="#ticket-triage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, not all bug reports in the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.djangoproject.com/newticket">ticket tracker</a> provide all
the <a class="reference internal" href="#id1">required details</a>. A number of tickets have patches, but those patches
don&#8217;t meet all the requirements of a <a class="reference internal" href="#patch-style">good patch</a>.</p>
<p>One way to help out is to <em>triage</em> bugs that have been reported by other
users. A couple of dedicated volunteers work on this regularly, but more help
is always appreciated.</p>
<p>Most of the workflow is based around the concept of a ticket&#8217;s &#8220;triage stage&#8221;.
This stage describes where in its lifetime a given ticket is at any time.
Along with a handful of flags, this field easily tells us what and who each
ticket is waiting on.</p>
<p>Since a picture is worth a thousand words, let&#8217;s start there:</p>
<img alt="Django's ticket workflow" src="../_images/djangotickets.png" style="width: 590px; height: 451px;" />
<p>We&#8217;ve got two official roles here:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Core developers: people with commit access who make the big decisions
and write the bulk of the code.</li>
<li>Ticket triagers: trusted community members with a proven history of
working with the Django community. As a result of this history, they
have been entrusted by the core developers to make some of the smaller
decisions about tickets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, note the five triage stages:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A ticket starts as &#8220;Unreviewed&#8221;, meaning that nobody has examined
the ticket.</li>
<li>&#8220;Design decision needed&#8221; means &#8220;this concept requires a design
decision,&#8221; which should be discussed either in the ticket comments or on
<a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers">django-developers</a>. The &#8220;Design decision needed&#8221; step will generally
only be used for feature requests. It can also be used for issues
that <em>might</em> be bugs, depending on opinion or interpretation. Obvious
bugs (such as crashes, incorrect query results, or non-compliance with a
standard) skip this step and move straight to &#8220;Accepted&#8221;.</li>
<li>Once a ticket is ruled to be approved for fixing, it&#8217;s moved into the
&#8220;Accepted&#8221; stage. This stage is where all the real work gets done.</li>
<li>In some cases, a ticket might get moved to the &#8220;Someday/Maybe&#8221; state.
This means the ticket is an enhancement request that we might consider
adding to the framework if an excellent patch is submitted. These
tickets are not a high priority.</li>
<li>If a ticket has an associated patch (see below), a triager will review
the patch. If the patch is complete, it&#8217;ll be marked as &#8220;ready for
checkin&#8221; so that a core developer knows to review and check in the
patches.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second part of this workflow involves a set of flags the describe what the
ticket has or needs in order to be &#8220;ready for checkin&#8221;:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>&#8220;Has patch&#8221;</dt>
<dd>This means the ticket has an associated <a class="reference internal" href="#submitting-patches">patch</a>. These will be
reviewed by the triage team to see if the patch is &#8220;good&#8221;.</dd>
<dt>&#8220;Needs documentation&#8221;</dt>
<dd>This flag is used for tickets with patches that need associated
documentation. Complete documentation of features is a prerequisite
before we can check a fix into the codebase.</dd>
<dt>&#8220;Needs tests&#8221;</dt>
<dd>This flags the patch as needing associated unit tests. Again, this is a
required part of a valid patch.</dd>
<dt>&#8220;Patch needs improvement&#8221;</dt>
<dd>This flag means that although the ticket <em>has</em> a patch, it&#8217;s not quite
ready for checkin. This could mean the patch no longer applies
cleanly, or that the code doesn&#8217;t live up to our standards.</dd>
</dl>
<p>A ticket can be resolved in a number of ways:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>&#8220;fixed&#8221;</dt>
<dd>Used by one of the core developers once a patch has been rolled into
Django and the issue is fixed.</dd>
<dt>&#8220;invalid&#8221;</dt>
<dd>Used if the ticket is found to be incorrect. This means that the
issue in the ticket is actually the result of a user error, or
describes a problem with something other than Django, or isn&#8217;t
a bug report or feature request at all (for example, some new users
submit support queries as tickets).</dd>
<dt>&#8220;wontfix&#8221;</dt>
<dd>Used when a core developer decides that this request is not
appropriate for consideration in Django. This is usually chosen after
discussion in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django-developers</span></tt> mailing list, and you should
feel free to join in when it&#8217;s something you care about.</dd>
<dt>&#8220;duplicate&#8221;</dt>
<dd>Used when another ticket covers the same issue. By closing duplicate
tickets, we keep all the discussion in one place, which helps everyone.</dd>
<dt>&#8220;worksforme&#8221;</dt>
<dd>Used when the ticket doesn&#8217;t contain enough detail to replicate
the original bug.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you believe that the ticket was closed in error &#8211; because you&#8217;re
still having the issue, or it&#8217;s popped up somewhere else, or the triagers have
&#8211; made a mistake, please reopen the ticket and tell us why. Please do not
reopen tickets that have been marked as &#8220;wontfix&#8221; by core developers.</p>
<div class="section" id="s-triage-by-the-general-community">
<span id="triage-by-the-general-community"></span><h3>Triage by the general community<a class="headerlink" href="#triage-by-the-general-community" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Although the core developers and ticket triagers make the big decisions in
the ticket triage process, there&#8217;s also a lot that general community
members can do to help the triage process. In particular, you can help out by:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Closing &#8220;Unreviewed&#8221; tickets as &#8220;invalid&#8221;, &#8220;worksforme&#8221; or &#8220;duplicate.&#8221;</li>
<li>Promoting &#8220;Unreviewed&#8221; tickets to &#8220;Design decision needed&#8221; if a design
decision needs to be made, or &#8220;Accepted&#8221; in case of obvious bugs.</li>
<li>Correcting the &#8220;Needs tests&#8221;, &#8220;Needs documentation&#8221;, or &#8220;Has patch&#8221; flags
for tickets where they are incorrectly set.</li>
<li>Checking that old tickets are still valid. If a ticket hasn&#8217;t seen
any activity in a long time, it&#8217;s possible that the problem has been
fixed but the ticket hasn&#8217;t yet been closed.</li>
<li>Contacting the owners of tickets that have been claimed but have not seen
any recent activity. If the owner doesn&#8217;t respond after a week or so,
remove the owner&#8217;s claim on the ticket.</li>
<li>Identifying trends and themes in the tickets. If there a lot of bug reports
about a particular part of Django, it may indicate we should consider
refactoring that part of the code. If a trend is emerging, you should
raise it for discussion (referencing the relevant tickets) on
<a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers">django-developers</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, we do ask the following of all general community members working in
the ticket database:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Please <strong>don&#8217;t</strong> close tickets as &#8220;wontfix.&#8221; The core developers will
make the final determination of the fate of a ticket, usually after
consultation with the community.</li>
<li>Please <strong>don&#8217;t</strong> promote tickets to &#8220;Ready for checkin&#8221; unless they are
<em>trivial</em> changes &#8211; for example, spelling mistakes or broken links in
documentation.</li>
<li>Please <strong>don&#8217;t</strong> reverse a decision that has been made by a core
developer. If you disagree with a discussion that has been made,
please post a message to <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers">django-developers</a>.</li>
<li>Please be conservative in your actions. If you&#8217;re unsure if you should
be making a change, don&#8217;t make the change &#8211; leave a comment with your
concerns on the ticket, or post a message to <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers">django-developers</a>.</li>

<p>Various parts of Django, such as the admin site and validation error messages,
are internationalized. This means they display different text depending on a
user&#8217;s language setting. For this, Django uses the same internationalization
infrastructure that is available to Django applications that is described
in the <a class="reference external" href="../topics/i18n.html#topics-i18n"><em>i18n documentation</em></a>.</p>
<p>These translations are contributed by Django users worldwide. If you find an
incorrect translation, or if you&#8217;d like to add a language that isn&#8217;t yet
translated, here&#8217;s what to do:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Join the <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-i18n/">Django i18n mailing list</a> and introduce yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Create translations using the methods described in the
<a class="reference external" href="../topics/i18n.html#topics-i18n"><em>i18n documentation</em></a>. For this you will use the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django-admin.py</span> <span class="pre">makemessages</span></tt> tool. In this particular case it should
be run from the top-level <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django</span></tt> directory of the Django source tree.</p>
<p>The script runs over the entire Django source tree and pulls out all
strings marked for translation. It creates (or updates) a message file in
the directory <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">conf/locale</span></tt> (for example for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pt-BR</span></tt>, the file will be
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">conf/locale/pt-br/LC_MESSAGES/django.po</span></tt>).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Make sure that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django-admin.py</span> <span class="pre">compilemessages</span> <span class="pre">-l</span> <span class="pre">&lt;lang&gt;</span></tt> runs without
producing any warnings.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Repeat the last two steps for the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">djangojs</span></tt> domain (by appending the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-d</span> <span class="pre">djangojs</span></tt> command line option to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django-admin.py</span></tt>
invocations).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Create a diff of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.po</span></tt> file(s) against the current Subversion trunk.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Open a ticket in Django&#8217;s ticket system, set its <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Component</span></tt> field to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Translations</span></tt>, and attach the patch to it.</p>

<p>We treat our documentation like we treat our code: we aim to improve it as
often as possible. This section explains how writers can craft their
documentation changes in the most useful and least error-prone ways.</p>
<p>Documentation changes come in two forms:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>General improvements -- Typo corrections, error fixes and better
explanations through clearer writing and more examples.</li>
<li>New features -- Documentation of features that have been added to the
framework since the last release.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our policy is:</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>All documentation of new features should be written in a way that clearly
designates the features are only available in the Django development
version. Assume documentation readers are using the latest release, not the
development version.</strong></blockquote>
<p>Our preferred way for marking new features is by prefacing the features'
documentation with: &quot;.. versionadded:: X.Y&quot;, followed by an optional one line
comment and a mandatory blank line.</p>
<p>General improvements, or other changes to the APIs that should be emphasized
should use the &quot;.. versionchanged:: X.Y&quot; directive (with the same format as the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">versionadded</span></tt> mentioned above.</p>

<li><strong>e-mail</strong> -- it has a hyphen.</li>
<li><strong>MySQL</strong></li>
<li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong></li>
<li><strong>Python</strong> -- when referring to the language, capitalize Python.</li>
<li><strong>realize</strong>, <strong>customize</strong>, <strong>initialize</strong>, etc. -- use the American
&quot;ize&quot; suffix, not &quot;ise.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>SQLite</strong></li>
<li><strong>subclass</strong> -- it's a single word without a hyphen, both as a verb
(&quot;subclass that model&quot;) and as a noun (&quot;create a subclass&quot;).</li>
<li><strong>Web</strong>, <strong>World Wide Web</strong>, <strong>the Web</strong> -- note Web is always

<p>Please follow these guidelines when committing code to Django's Subversion

<ul>
<li><p class="first">For any medium-to-big changes, where &quot;medium-to-big&quot; is according to your
judgment, please bring things up on the <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers">django-developers</a> mailing list
before making the change.</p>
<p>If you bring something up on <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers">django-developers</a> and nobody responds,
please don't take that to mean your idea is great and should be
implemented immediately because nobody contested it. Django's lead
developers don't have a lot of time to read mailing-list discussions
immediately, so you may have to wait a couple of days before getting a
response.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Write detailed commit messages in the past tense, not present tense.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Good: &quot;Fixed Unicode bug in RSS API.&quot;</li>
<li>Bad: &quot;Fixes Unicode bug in RSS API.&quot;</li>
<li>Bad: &quot;Fixing Unicode bug in RSS API.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">For commits to a branch, prefix the commit message with the branch name.
For example: &quot;magic-removal: Added support for mind reading.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Limit commits to the most granular change that makes sense. This means,
use frequent small commits rather than infrequent large commits. For
example, if implementing feature X requires a small change to library Y,
first commit the change to library Y, then commit feature X in a separate
commit. This goes a <em>long way</em> in helping all core Django developers
follow your changes.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Separate bug fixes from feature changes.</p>
<p>Bug fixes need to be added to the current bugfix branch (e.g. the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">1.0.X</span></tt> branch) as well as the current trunk.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If your commit closes a ticket in the Django <a class="reference external" href="http://code.djangoproject.com/newticket">ticket tracker</a>, begin
your commit message with the text &quot;Fixed #abc&quot;, where &quot;abc&quot; is the number
of the ticket your commit fixes. Example: &quot;Fixed #123 -- Added support
for foo&quot;. We've rigged Subversion and Trac so that any commit message
in that format will automatically close the referenced ticket and post a
comment to it with the full commit message.</p>
<p>If your commit closes a ticket and is in a branch, use the branch name
first, then the &quot;Fixed #abc.&quot; For example:
&quot;magic-removal: Fixed #123 -- Added whizbang feature.&quot;</p>
<p>For the curious: We're using a <a class="reference external" href="http://trac.edgewall.org/browser/trunk/contrib/trac-post-commit-hook">Trac post-commit hook</a> for this.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If your commit references a ticket in the Django <a class="reference external" href="http://code.djangoproject.com/newticket">ticket tracker</a> but

<p>The tests cover:</p>

<p>Yes, the unit tests need a settings module, but only for database connection

<p>If you're using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sqlite3</span></tt> database backend, no further settings are
needed. A temporary database will be created in memory when running the tests.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Your <a class="reference external" href="../ref/settings.html#setting-DATABASE_USER"><tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">DATABASE_USER</span></tt></a> setting needs to specify an existing user account
for the database engine.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="../ref/settings.html#setting-DATABASE_NAME"><tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">DATABASE_NAME</span></tt></a> setting must be the name of an existing database to
which the given user has permission to connect. The unit tests will not
touch this database; the test runner creates a new database whose name is
<a class="reference external" href="../ref/settings.html#setting-DATABASE_NAME"><tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">DATABASE_NAME</span></tt></a> prefixed with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test_</span></tt>, and this test database is
deleted when the tests are finished. This means your user account needs
permission to execute <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CREATE</span> <span class="pre">DATABASE</span></tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also need to ensure that your database uses UTF-8 as the default
character set. If your database server doesn't use UTF-8 as a default charset,
you will need to include a value for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">TEST_DATABASE_CHARSET</span></tt> in your settings
file.</p>

</ul>
<p>If you want to test the memcached cache backend, you will also need to define
a <a class="reference external" href="../ref/settings.html#setting-CACHE_BACKEND"><tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">CACHE_BACKEND</span></tt></a> setting that points at your memcached instance.</p>
<p>Each of these dependencies is optional. If you're missing any of them, the
associated tests will be skipped.</p>
<p>To run a subset of the unit tests, append the names of the test modules to the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">runtests.py</span></tt> command line. See the list of directories in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tests/modeltests</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tests/regressiontests</span></tt> for module names.</p>
<p>As an example, if Django is not in your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PYTHONPATH</span></tt>, you placed
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">settings.py</span></tt> in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tests/</span></tt> directory, and you'd like to only run tests
for generic relations and internationalization, type:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">PYTHONPATH</span><span class="o">=</span>..
./runtests.py --settings<span class="o">=</span>settings generic_relations i18n

<p>Tests for apps in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django/contrib/</span></tt> go in their respective directories under
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django/contrib/</span></tt>, in a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tests.py</span></tt> file. (You can split the tests over
multiple modules by using a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tests</span></tt> directory in the normal Python way.)</p>
<p>For the tests to be found, a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">models.py</span></tt> file must exist (it doesn't
have to have anything in it). If you have URLs that need to be

<div class="section" id="s-requesting-features">
<span id="requesting-features"></span><h2>Requesting features<a class="headerlink" href="#requesting-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We're always trying to make Django better, and your feature requests are a key
part of that. Here are some tips on how to most effectively make a request:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Request the feature on <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers">django-developers</a>, not in the ticket tracker;
it'll get read more closely if it's on the mailing list.</li>
<li>Describe clearly and concisely what the missing feature is and how you'd
like to see it implemented. Include example code (non-functional is OK)
if possible.</li>
<li>Explain <em>why</em> you'd like the feature. In some cases this is obvious, but
since Django is designed to help real developers get real work done,
you'll need to explain it, if it isn't obvious why the feature would be
useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with most open-source projects, code talks. If you are willing to write the
code for the feature yourself or if (even better) you've already written it,
it's much more likely to be accepted.  If it's a large feature that might need
multiple developers we're always happy to give you an experimental branch in
our repository; see below.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="s-branch-policy">
<span id="branch-policy"></span><h2>Branch policy<a class="headerlink" href="#branch-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In general, the trunk must be kept stable. People should be able to run
production sites against the trunk at any time. Additionally, commits to trunk
ought to be as atomic as possible -- smaller changes are better. Thus, large
feature changes -- that is, changes too large to be encapsulated in a single
patch, or changes that need multiple eyes on them -- must happen on dedicated
branches.</p>
<p>This means that if you want to work on a large feature -- anything that would
take more than a single patch, or requires large-scale refactoring -- you need
to do it on a feature branch. Our development process recognizes two options
for feature branches:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Feature branches using a distributed revision control system like
<a class="reference external" href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/">Mercurial</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar</a>, etc.</p>
<p>If you're familiar with one of these tools, this is probably your best
option since it doesn't require any support or buy-in from the Django
core developers.</p>
<p>However, do keep in mind that Django will continue to use Subversion for
the foreseeable future, and this will naturally limit the recognition of
your branch. Further, if your branch becomes eligible for merging to
trunk you'll need to find a core developer familiar with your DVCS of
choice who'll actually perform the merge.</p>
<p>If you do decided to start a distributed branch of Django and choose to make it
public, please add the branch to the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/DjangoBranches">Django branches</a> wiki page.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Feature branches using SVN have a higher bar. If you want a branch in SVN
itself, you'll need a &quot;mentor&quot; among the <a class="reference external" href="committers.html#internals-committers"><em>core committers</em></a>. This person is responsible for actually creating
the branch, monitoring your process (see below), and ultimately merging
the branch into trunk.</p>
<p>If you want a feature branch in SVN, you'll need to ask in
<a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers">django-developers</a> for a mentor.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="s-branch-rules">
<span id="branch-rules"></span><h3>Branch rules<a class="headerlink" href="#branch-rules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We've got a few rules for branches born out of experience with what makes a
successful Django branch.</p>
<p>DVCS branches are obviously not under central control, so we have no way of
enforcing these rules. However, if you're using a DVCS, following these rules
will give you the best chance of having a successful branch (read: merged back to
trunk).</p>
<p>Developers with branches in SVN, however, <strong>must</strong> follow these rules. The
branch mentor will keep on eye on the branch and <strong>will delete it</strong> if these
rules are broken.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Only branch entire copies of the Django tree, even if work is only
happening on part of that tree. This makes it painless to switch to a
branch.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Merge changes from trunk no less than once a week, and preferably every
couple-three days.</p>
<p>In our experience, doing regular trunk merges is often the difference
between a successful branch and one that fizzles and dies.</p>
<p>If you're working on an SVN branch, you should be using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.orcaware.com/svn/wiki/Svnmerge.py">svnmerge.py</a>
to track merges from trunk.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Keep tests passing and documentation up-to-date. As with patches,
we'll only merge a branch that comes with tests and documentation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the branch is stable and ready to be merged into the trunk, alert
<a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers">django-developers</a>.</p>
<p>After a branch has been merged, it should be considered &quot;dead&quot;; write access to
it will be disabled, and old branches will be periodically &quot;trimmed.&quot; To keep
our SVN wrangling to a minimum, we won't be merging from a given branch into the
trunk more than once.</p>

<div class="section" id="s-using-branches">
<span id="using-branches"></span><h3>Using branches<a class="headerlink" href="#using-branches" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To use a branch, you'll need to do two things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Get the branch's code through Subversion.</li>
<li>Point your Python <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">site-packages</span></tt> directory at the branch's version of
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django</span></tt> package rather than the version you already have
installed.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="s-getting-the-code-from-subversion">
<span id="getting-the-code-from-subversion"></span><h4>Getting the code from Subversion<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-the-code-from-subversion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>To get the latest version of a branch's code, check it out using Subversion:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre>svn co http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/branches/&lt;branch&gt;/
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>...where <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;branch&gt;</span></tt> is the branch's name. See the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.djangoproject.com/browser/django/branches">list of branch names</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can automatically convert an existing directory of the
Django source code as long as you've checked it out via Subversion. To do the
conversion, execute this command from within your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django</span></tt> directory:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre>svn switch http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/branches/&lt;branch&gt;/
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The advantage of using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">svn</span> <span class="pre">switch</span></tt> instead of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">svn</span> <span class="pre">co</span></tt> is that the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">switch</span></tt> command retains any changes you might have made to your local copy
of the code. It attempts to merge those changes into the &quot;switched&quot; code. The
disadvantage is that it may cause conflicts with your local changes if the
&quot;switched&quot; code has altered the same lines of code.</p>
<p>(Note that if you use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">svn</span> <span class="pre">switch</span></tt>, you don't need to point Python at the new
version, as explained in the next section.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="s-pointing-python-at-the-new-django-version">
<span id="pointing-python-at-the-new-django-version"></span><h4>Pointing Python at the new Django version<a class="headerlink" href="#pointing-python-at-the-new-django-version" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Once you've retrieved the branch's code, you'll need to change your Python
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">site-packages</span></tt> directory so that it points to the branch version of the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django</span></tt> directory. (The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">site-packages</span></tt> directory is somewhere such as
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages</span></tt> or
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/usr/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C:\Python\site-packages</span></tt>.)</p>
<p>The simplest way to do this is by renaming the old <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django</span></tt> directory to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django.OLD</span></tt> and moving the trunk version of the code into the directory
and calling it <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use a symlink called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django</span></tt> that points to the
location of the branch's <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django</span></tt> package. If you want to switch back, just
change the symlink to point to the old code.</p>
<p>A third option is to use a <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-site.html">path file</a> (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;something&gt;.pth</span></tt>) which should
work on all systems (including Windows, which doesn't have symlinks
available). First, make sure there are no files, directories or symlinks named
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django</span></tt> in your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">site-packages</span></tt> directory. Then create a text file named
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django.pth</span></tt> and save it to your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">site-packages</span></tt> directory. That file
should contain a path to your copy of Django on a single line and optional
comments. Here is an example that points to multiple branches. Just uncomment
the line for the branch you want to use ('Trunk' in this example) and make
sure all other lines are commented:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre># Trunk is a svn checkout of:
#   http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk/
#
/path/to/trunk

# &lt;branch&gt; is a svn checkout of:
#   http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/branches/&lt;branch&gt;/
#
#/path/to/&lt;branch&gt;

# On windows a path may look like this:
# C:/path/to/&lt;branch&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p>If you're using Django 0.95 or earlier and installed it using
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">setup.py</span> <span class="pre">install</span></tt>, you'll have a directory called something like
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Django-0.95-py2.4.egg</span></tt> instead of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django</span></tt>. In this case, edit the file
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">setuptools.pth</span></tt> and remove the line that references the Django <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.egg</span></tt>
file. Then copy the branch's version of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django</span></tt> directory into
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">site-packages</span></tt>.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="s-deciding-on-features">
<span id="deciding-on-features"></span><h2>Deciding on features<a class="headerlink" href="#deciding-on-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once a feature's been requested and discussed, eventually we'll have a decision
about whether to include the feature or drop it.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, we strive for a rough consensus. To that end, we'll often
have informal votes on <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers">django-developers</a> about a feature. In these votes we
follow the voting style invented by Apache and used on Python itself, where
votes are given as +1, +0, -0, or -1.  Roughly translated, these votes mean:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>+1: &quot;I love the idea and I'm strongly committed to it.&quot;</li>
<li>+0: &quot;Sounds OK to me.&quot;</li>
<li>-0: &quot;I'm not thrilled, but I won't stand in the way.&quot;</li>
<li>-1: &quot;I strongly disagree and would be very unhappy to see the idea turn
into reality.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Although these votes on django-developers are informal, they'll be taken very
seriously. After a suitable voting period, if an obvious consensus arises
we'll follow the votes.</p>
<p>However, consensus is not always possible.  Tough decisions will be discussed by
all full committers and finally decided by the Benevolent Dictators for Life,
Adrian and Jacob.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="s-commit-access">
<span id="commit-access"></span><h2>Commit access<a class="headerlink" href="#commit-access" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Django has two types of committers:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Full committers</dt>
<dd><p class="first">These are people who have a long history of contributions to Django's
codebase, a solid track record of being polite and helpful on the mailing
lists, and a proven desire to dedicate serious time to Django's development.</p>
<p class="last">The bar is very high for full commit access. It will only be granted by
unanimous approval of all existing full committers, and the decision will err
on the side of rejection.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Partial committers</dt>
<dd><p class="first">These are people who are &quot;domain experts.&quot; They have direct check-in access
to the subsystems that fall under their jurisdiction, and they're given a
formal vote in questions that involve their subsystems. This type of access
is likely to be given to someone who contributes a large subframework to
Django and wants to continue to maintain it.</p>
<p class="last">Like full committers, partial commit access is by unanimous approval of all
full committers (and any other partial committers in the same area).
However, the bar is set lower; proven expertise in the area in question is
likely to be sufficient.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>To request commit access, please contact an existing committer privately. Public
requests for commit access are potential flame-war starters, and will be ignored.</p>
